# Credit-Risk-Assessment-Using-Probability-and-Statistics

### Problem Statement :
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the credit risk level of individuals based on their financial and credit history. The model will classify users into four risk categories — P1 (Low Risk), P2 (Moderate Risk), P3 (High Risk), and P4 (Very High Risk) — using probability-based statistical analysis.

To make the system user-friendly and interactive, a Streamlit dashboard will be developed. This dashboard will allow users to:

- Enter customer data through a form,
- Get an instant risk prediction,
- View detailed analysis explaining why the prediction was made.

This project aims to support financial institutions in making informed decisions when offering loans or credit, by providing a transparent and data-driven risk assessment tool.
